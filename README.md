# Aether Protocol 🌌

**Aether** is a decentralized perpetual futures protocol built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/), designed for speed, modularity, and interchain composability.

We are building the foundation for a permissionless derivatives economy — open to anyone, everywhere, with deep liquidity and fast finality.

## 🧠 What is Aether?

Aether is a **modular, application-specific blockchain** focused on **perpetual derivatives**. It allows developers and traders to:

- Trade perpetual futures with on-chain settlement
- Build custom market mechanisms and margin engines
- Interoperate across the Cosmos ecosystem via IBC
- Launch community-governed markets and strategies

> "In ancient cosmology, Aether was the fifth element — the divine substance that fills the heavens. Our mission is to bring decentralized derivatives to that layer."
